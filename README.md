Happy nutrition provides consultations to improve gut health, digestion, hormone balance, and stress management through personalized diet, targeted supplementation, and transformative lifestyle changes. The main website, www.happynutrition.ca, is currently used for advertising and selling supplements.

There are 2 websites under development. An online learning platform, www.healthacademy.ca, is published and it will be promoted to public soon. However, the client wants changes on the website by improving performance, fixing some bugs, making user-friendly, and more importantly adding AI chatbot that allows users to have informative conversations regarding the course materials and nutrition advice. 

In the implementation folder there will be 2 folder healthacademy and AskNutritionist-main.
